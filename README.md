# Project Description
* We want to accomplish implementing some form of behavior tree that succesfully runs a "lab rat" through a maze in Unity, using a mix of C# and Unity
* We want to do this because of this will help me (Ben) learn the tools before having to do a similar, but more intense group project with the same tools. Nate would like to learn C# for a company he is interested in interning at. 
* Doing this will require learning more than basic coding skills, learning the C# language, learning how to use the Unity game engine, and potentially using visual basic.
* We anticipate the following challenges: Getting used to the Unity system, coding with new syntax, spending hours in youtube tutorials, and getting frustrated to no end over making basic mistakes and running into them later down the line.
